                    <h6>I AM RELATED TO COMPUTING</h6>
                    <p>I study information security as a undergraduate. Coincidentally I play and organize information
                        security challenges with [team Team].</p>
                    <p>I don't really like the status quo of computing, though I do enjoy tinkering with obscure
                        programming
                        languages and with my text editor.</p>
                    <h6>I AM RELATED TO DESIGN</h6>
                    <p>Sometimes I draw posters, logos and maps. I also make user interfaces and websites.</p>
                    <h6>I ALSO DO OTHER THINGS</h6>
                    <p>In my free time I make music. Check out my Bandcamp. I also have a dump with lots of demos and
                        unfinished projects.</p>
                    <p>Some subsets of math and physics are fascinating to me, too, albeit my understanding of these
                        subjects could be better. The background of this page is a real-time computer simulation of a
                        very
                        famous Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, by the way.</p>
